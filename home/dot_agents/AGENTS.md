# Global agent rules

These rules apply to every coding session, across every project.

**Precedence:** the **closest `AGENTS.md`** to the files you're changing wins. This file holds cross-tool defaults; project and directory `AGENTS.md` files override on conflict. See the [Memory](#memory) section for where each file lives.

## Always active

These constraints are unconditional. Apply them without being asked.

- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, or restructure the sentence. Never generate inline `—` or `&mdash;` as punctuation. (Markdown horizontal rules: `---` alone on a line is fine.)
- **Never guess schemas or APIs.** Read the authoritative source first: Go structs, official docs, or the project's own examples. Blog posts and AI-generated examples are not acceptable.
- **Verify a dependency supports the target platform before designing around it.** Before locking in a spec that depends on a third-party tool on a specific OS, confirm artifacts and source actually support that OS: run `gh release view --json assets` to see what's published, check the upstream CI matrix for the OSes it builds, and grep the source for OS-specific imports or build tags. Project names and descriptions don't imply cross-platform binaries; many "general" tools are Linux-only at the artifact level even when the README sounds portable.
- **Diagnose from logs, not theory.** When investigating a failure (CI, runtime, hang, regression), the last lines of output before the failure are ground truth, not a guess based on which script's name matches your current hypothesis or which prior bug looked similar. If the visible log doesn't pin the cause, add a diagnostic and re-run rather than speculate further. When reporting findings, mark claims as observed ("log line N says X") versus suspected ("I think Y because…") and never let suspicion harden into assertion without evidence.
- **Stub APIs permissively, capture narrowly.** When a loopback or mock server intercepts an API client to capture requests, return a permissive default (`200 {}` or a minimal valid response object) for unhandled paths, and only persist the body for the specific path you care about. Real clients often probe other endpoints (capability checks, model lookups, version handshakes) before sending the request you want to intercept; a 404 on a pre-flight probe makes them bail before reaching the target path. Reserve 404 for paths that genuinely must not exist.
- **One sample isn't a measurement.** A single run, repro, or test pass doesn't characterise a noisy phenomenon. Before claiming X differs from Y (faster, more reliable, fixed, broken), gather enough samples to see variance, then report it. Applies anywhere outcomes vary: perf benchmarks, flaky tests, network calls, CI on managed infra, A/B comparisons. If you've only got one data point, mark the conclusion provisional, do not open a PR or change production on it.
- **Clone, don't curl.** When reading another repository's source, `git clone` first and read locally. Never `curl` GitHub API endpoints or `curl` raw file URLs to read source, even when docs don't render. (Using `WebFetch` for public documentation pages is fine.)
- **All Python through mise.** Never invoke `python`, `pip`, `uv`, or `uvx` directly. Use `mise x -- <command>` for all Python toolchain work.
- **Never accept a limitation without investigating.** Keep working until the problem is actually solved. Suggesting workarounds as a final answer is not acceptable.
- **Never silence the signal to make CI green.** If a lint rule, security check, or test surfaces real findings during a dep update or refactor, fix the findings, not the alarm. Disabling a linter (e.g. adding to `DISABLE_LINTERS`), broadening an exclude regex, marking a test skipped, or filtering out a real finding in service of an unblocked merge is unacceptable. Genuine false positives can be excluded with a comment naming the specific rule and reason; real findings cannot. If the underlying fix is out of scope for the current PR, leave the PR red with a comment naming the follow-up work, not green with the check muted.
- **Deliver the answer, not instructions to derive it.** When the user asks you to find, fetch, or compute a specific value, produce the value. Do not respond with a snippet for them to run, a formula to apply, or "tell me which one and I'll convert it" when you have the tools to do the lookup yourself. The user delegated the work; punting it back defeats the purpose.
- **Don't say "Docker containers."** Docker is a brand name, not a container type. Write "containers" or "OCI images" in prose. Action references like `docker/login-action` are fine as-is.
- **Never commit secrets.** No API keys, tokens, `.env` files, credentials, or private keys in any repo. If staged accidentally, unstage and remove from history before pushing. If already pushed, rotate the secret immediately; force-push history rewrite only with explicit user confirmation.
- **Never log PII.** No email, phone, name, address, or payment data in logs, traces, or monitoring payloads.
- **Run a retrospective before closing out.** After every non-trivial task, invoke the `retrospective` skill to capture lessons for global memory.

## Memory

| Scope | Deployed path | Edit (source of truth) |
|---|---|---|
| Global cross-tool rules | `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/dot_agents/AGENTS.md` |
| Global cross-tool skills | `~/.agents/skills/` | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/dot_agents/skills/` |
| Project rules | `./AGENTS.md` (project root or nearest ancestor) | same path |
| Chezmoi repo rules | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/AGENTS.md` | same path |

Always edit the source, not the deployed file. When updating any memory file: review nearby rules for contradictions, duplication, and scope conflicts; reconcile in the same edit. Keep cross-cutting rules in global memory; keep project-specific rules in local memory.

## Git and commits

- **Check for prior work before starting a fix.** When the task is to fix a specific CI failure, bug, or pre-described change, scan `gh pr list --state all --search <keywords>` and `git worktree list` before reading code or planning. Previous sessions or parallel agents may already have a branch, open PR, or merged PR matching the scope; duplicating that work wastes effort and risks conflicting changes.
- Before committing, run `git diff --staged` and confirm the change is atomic and in-scope. Do not commit unrelated modifications.
- Commit message format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`. Check `git log --oneline` to match repo style.
- After any branch switch (including `gh pr checkout`), verify with `git branch --show-current`. If `gh pr checkout` fails or lands on the wrong branch, use `git checkout <branch>` directly.
- A stale `.git/index.lock` blocks all git operations. Remove it with `rm -f .git/index.lock` before retrying the blocked command.
- **A half-populated working tree with no `.git/index` is a failed content filter, not a bad clone.** Git writes the index only after a successful checkout, so a missing `.git/index` plus files that stop partway through the alphabet means checkout aborted mid-run. The usual cause is a filter declared mandatory in gitconfig (`filter.lfs.required = true`) whose binary is absent: git treats the failure as fatal and abandons every remaining path. Check `git config --get-regexp '^filter\.'` and confirm the helper resolves on PATH before blaming the transport, and note that HTTPS versus SSH is irrelevant because the objects already arrived. The corollary for provisioning: config that hard-requires an external binary and the install of that binary must ship together, so when adding a `required = true` filter or similar mandatory helper to dotfiles, add the package in the same change.
- **Prove what a destructive recovery command will destroy before running it.** When the index is missing or untrustworthy, `git status` is not evidence: with no index every tracked file reports as both a staged deletion and untracked, which looks like catastrophic local change when nothing is wrong. Build a throwaway index and diff against it first: `GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp) git read-tree HEAD && git diff --diff-filter=d --name-only HEAD` shows real modifications separately from merely-absent files. Only once that comes back empty is `git reset --hard` provably lossless. Generalise past git: before any irreversible repair, run the read-only query that quantifies the blast radius and report the number, rather than reasoning that the operation is probably safe.
- **Worktree context.**
    - When the cwd is inside a Claude Code worktree (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/<id>`), git and gh commands act on the worktree branch. The main repo's working tree may be locked by another agent; do not `git checkout` or `gh pr checkout` against it.
    - To pull a PR branch, materialize it into a new worktree: `git -C /path/to/main-repo fetch origin <branch> && git -C /path/to/main-repo worktree add <path> origin/<branch>`.
    - Use `git -C <path>` for all subsequent commands. Confirm the active branch with `git -C <path> branch --show-current` before reading or editing files.
    - **Anchor subagent commands to the worktree explicitly.** When dispatching subagents from inside a worktree, include `cd <absolute-worktree-path> && <command>` (or pass absolute paths) in every Bash invocation in the subagent's prompt. Subagents may run from a different effective cwd than the controller, and from a sibling main repo at a parent path you get superficially plausible but wrong git/file answers (e.g. a staged file reported as unstaged, a CRLF-free file reported as CRLF, HEAD reported as a different commit). The signal that you've hit this: the subagent reports a state that contradicts what you can directly verify yourself, and re-dispatching with explicit anchoring makes the contradiction disappear.
- **After a PR merges, proactively offer to clean up its worktree and branches.** When the user confirms a PR has been merged (or you observe the merge while working), surface a cleanup offer via `AskUserQuestion` before doing anything destructive. The cleanup is: `git worktree remove <path>`, `git branch -D <name>` locally, and `git push origin --delete <name>` (often a no-op because GitHub auto-deletes the head branch on merge). Refuse to delete dirty worktrees without explicit per-tree consent. If the current shell's CWD is inside the worktree being removed, expect a "Permission denied" on the directory itself: the git entry, contents, and branches still get cleaned, leaving only an empty husk that vanishes once the shell exits.
- **Cloning for tag comparison.** `--depth=1 --no-single-branch` does not fetch tags. When you need to compare specific tags, either clone without `--depth`, or run `git fetch --tags` after the shallow clone.
- **Inspecting a PR's diff.** Always diff the remote PR branch against `origin/main` (e.g. `git diff origin/main...origin/<pr-branch>`), not local HEAD. Local HEAD may be on an unrelated branch, so a diff against it is meaningless and returns empty output without any error.
- **Before opening a PR: clean up history.** Squash messy work-in-progress or AI-attributed commits into a clean, atomic commit sequence on the branch. The branch is yours until `gh pr create` succeeds.
- **Once a PR is open: never amend or force-push.** Use follow-up commits so reviewers see exactly what changed between their review and your response. The branch now belongs to the reviewer; rewriting it erases the diff they expect to see. Preserve every change as a separate commit.

## Shell discipline

- Prefer the smallest atomic command that completes the immediate next step. Do not chain concerns across policy boundaries.
- Destructive or policy-sensitive actions should be isolated so intent is easy to inspect.
- Do not check whether a directory exists before using it. Attempt the operation; create the directory if it fails.
- On Windows, when admin rights are required, launch elevated commands with `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` instead of failing back to manual instructions.
- On Windows, use the Bash tool (not PowerShell) for POSIX-style commands like `grep`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, and path operations that use forward slashes. Use PowerShell only when you need Windows-native cmdlets, `$env:` variables, or paths with backslashes that POSIX tools cannot handle.
- On Windows, POSIX-style paths like `/tmp/...` resolve only inside the Bash tool. Native filesystem tools (read/edit/write/grep/glob in any agent harness) use Windows file APIs and need Windows-style paths (`C:\...` or `C:/...`). When a Bash command reports a canonical path (e.g. `Cloning into 'C:/Users/.../Temp/repo'`), use that path for subsequent tool calls; do not reuse the `/tmp/` shortcut.

## Toolchain

- When a CLI can be managed by `mise`, run it through `mise x -- <command>`. Do not invoke managed tools directly.
- When entering a new worktree that has a `mise.toml` or `.mise.toml`, run `mise trust <worktree-path>/{mise,.mise}.toml` (or the specific file present) before any `mise x --` call. Otherwise every mise invocation fails with `Config files in <path> are not trusted`.
- **`mise x -- go install` puts binaries in mise's GOBIN, not `$HOME/go/bin/`.** mise's Go install has its own GOBIN (typically `<mise root>/installs/go/<ver>/bin/`), so binaries installed through `mise x -- go install ...` do not appear under `$HOME/go/bin/`. Scripts that fall back to `$HOME/go/bin/<tool>` will not find them. Either set `GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin mise x -- go install <pkg>` to land it there, or copy the resulting `<mise root>/installs/go/<ver>/bin/<tool>` into `$HOME/go/bin/` after install.
- **Git hooks inherit the invoker's PATH, so mise-managed hook tools need mise activation.** When `pre-commit`, `bats`, or any other mise-managed binary is wired into `.git/hooks/*`, running `git commit` from a shell without mise on PATH fails with `<tool> not found.  Did you forget to activate your virtualenv?` (or similar). Wrap the commit in `mise x -- bash -c 'git commit ...'` so the hook subprocess inherits the shim path; this is the default workaround whenever the Bash tool's plain PATH is missing mise's tools.
